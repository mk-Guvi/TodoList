## A Todolist App with Nested Tasks

https://www.loom.com/share/6376c251caf743f896f6d9f1d7fa3e55

## Getting Started

#### Dependency Setup

- Next Js
- React
- Typescript
- node version: ^18.14.2

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Branching Conventions

- `main` - Stable code for release.
- `release/[version-number]` - Base branch for development release.
- `feature/[feature-name]` - Feature branch derived from **release/[version-number]**.
- `fix/[feature-name]` - Hotfix branch after the `release` branch has been merged to **main**.
